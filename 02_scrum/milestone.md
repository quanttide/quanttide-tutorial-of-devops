# 敏捷里程碑

## 定义

里程碑是项目计划里某一个节点的标记，比如重要的更变、重要的时刻等。

> a milestone marks an important change, moment, or deliverable in the project plan.

### 里程碑和路线图的区别

里程碑：
> A milestone is a marker of a stage in a project.

路线图：
> A roadmap is a plan - it often relates milestones and dependencies between them and gives stakeholders some insight into when work will be available or delivered.

## 优点

> Imagine having a map with no checkpoints. So you know where you’re starting your journey and where you need to get, but you don’t know what you’re supposed to do on your path there.

> They provide a step-by-step roadmap of every feature or item that needs to be completed so you’ll never be left wondering what’s next on your team’s work tray.
